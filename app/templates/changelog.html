    <ul>
      <li class='honk'>Hello, new changelog page! I'm not going to even pretend to have a proper versioning system, so here's dates instead.</li>
      <li class='added'>Added a hover tooltip to the death counter on match pages.</li>
      <li class='removed'>Due to some optimizations to how data is stored, matches before today have been lost because the migration would honestly be painful to perform. This shouldn't happen again for some time.</li>
      <li>Current plans involve a better view on mobile and adding display of things that have been gathered for a long time but never actually shown anywhere (uplink items!)</li>
      <li>If you have something you want to see added, check the issues list on <i class='fa fa-github-alt'></i> GitHub (link in the top right) to see if it's in the works, then either nag me about it on that issue, or make a new one to nag about one that isn't listed.</li>
      <li>That includes things as simple as "X should be more visible!"</li>
